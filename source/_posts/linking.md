## [assimilation of /d/ to /g/](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/pronunciation/tims-pronunciation-workshop-ep-15)

"In fluent speech, a /d/ changes to a /g/ when it comes before a /g/ or a /k/. So 'bad girl' becomes 'bagirl'. This is an example of what is called assimilation. Here are some more."

- bad_girl
- He’s a really good_cook.
- Last night we had_guests for dinner.
- Can you print out the hard_copy?
- I’d love to walk down the red_carpet one day.

---

## [can](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/pronunciation/tims-pronunciation-workshop-ep-16)

In fluent everyday English, when the modal auxiliary 'can' is unstressed, its pronunciation changes to /kən/. 'I /kæn/ speak four languages' becomes: 'I /kən/ speak four languages'. This is what's known as a weak form and it can occur in questions as well. Here are some more examples.

- I can speak two languages.
- Can you help me bring in the shopping, please?
- I **can** swim further than I **can** run.
- You can succeed if you work_hard.
- How far can you throw a tennis ball?

---

## /d/ /b/, /t/, /p/, /k/ and /g/

In fluent, everyday speech, when one word ends in a plosive sound and the next begins in another consonant sound, we don’t always hear the release of the plosive sound. 'I'd like to', becomes 'Idliketuh'.

How about a quick_chat?
You should_thank her.
It was a sad_time in his life.
Why don't you sit_down?
I hurt_my finger.

---

## the

If the next word begins in a consonant sound, it’s pronounced /ðə/. I prefer the blue one. But, if the next word begins in a vowel sound, it’s pronounced /ðɪː/. I prefer the orange one. And you might remember from a previous video that when the sound /ɪː/ is followed by a vowel sound, you might also hear a small linking /j/ in between.

---

## [linking /j/](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/pronunciation/tims-pronunciation-workshop-ep-19)

when one word ends in /aɪ/, /ɪː/, /eɪ/ or/ɔɪ/ sound, and the next word begins in a vowel sound, we can smooth the link out by adding a small /j/ sound

- I_always have some breakfast.
- When I go on holiday I just want to lie_on the beach.
- The_end of the film was brilliant.
- I_ate the whole cake in one go.
- It was too high_up for me to reach.

## [pronunciation /s/ /z/](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/pronunciation/vlessconst7)

---

## Been

In fluent everyday English, when the auxiliary 'been' is not stressed its pronunciation changes to /bɪn/. 'I've been in London since 2015' becomes 'I've /bɪn/ in London since 2015'. This is what's known as a weak form and it helps speech to flow more naturally and fluently. Here are some more examples.

- I've been in London seventeen years.
- I've been working here for several years.
- How long have you been waiting?
- It's been years since I went to the cinema.
- What have you been up to since we last met?

---

## assimilation of /s/

- Bless you.
- Can you just_shut the door please?
- This_yacht is beautiful.
- Don't worry, that's_usual.
- He always makes_you feel good.

---

## from

when it's unstressed, and it comes in the middle of a sentence, the /ɒ/ changes to schwa, so /frɒm/ becomes /frəm/.

- I borrowed it from my brother.
- I read the book from cover to cover.
- The nearest post office is not far from here.
- Come over any time from seven o'clock.

---

## the gemination of /t/

- It takes two to tango.
- It took him twenty years to get to the top.
- You don’t have to cheat to pass the test.
- You were right to be upset.
- We took the overnight train to Venice.

---

## assimilation of /d/ and /b/

if one word ends in a vowel sound followed by a /d/ and the next begins in a /b/, then the /d/ changes to a /b/ and then merges with the /b/ from the following word. So ‘speed boat’, becomes ‘speebboat’.

- Speed boat.
- My son is a really good boy.
- I’m sorry if I was rude before.
- My car had to be towed back to the garage.
- You should buy him a present.
