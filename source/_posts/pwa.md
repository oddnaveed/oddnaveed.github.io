Here are something's that is going to be useful (by Frinze):

1. Big Query + Google Sheets - https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/connecting-bigquery-and-google-sheets-to-help-with-hefty-data-analysis
   https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9077536?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en
2. Firebase Auth

3. Big query and Qualtrics
   https://zapier.com/apps/google-bigquery/integrations/qualtrics or
   https://tray.io/connectors/google-bigquery-qualtrics-integrations or
   https://www.qualtrics.com/community/discussion/comment/5848#Comment_5773 (most recommended using API after survey completion)

4. Qualtrics + React
   https://www.qualtrics.com/support/website-app-feedback/common-use-cases/single-page-application/

5. Linking Firebase with BigQuery (you'll need this for cloud functions - invitations/remind)... You will possibly need to find out how to access survey to expose it for reminders... that will require Custom Cloud functions built with node that will interact with qualtrics
