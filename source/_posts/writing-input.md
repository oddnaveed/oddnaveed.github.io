## opening

- "It is true that genetic engineering is a key area of modern scientific research, **with broad implications for all human societies**. While I accept that this field of technology may have its dangers, I believe that the benefits of genetic engineering **outweigh** the drawbacks.

**The negative implications of** genetic engineering are often discussed in terms of two key areas, which are **food production and the cloning of humans**. Genetically modified crops are already being grown, and people are concerned that they may **damage whole ecosystems** as foods **become resistant to diseases and natural predators**. For example, scientists are able to produce **a variety of** corn that releases a toxin to kill certain insects, but this **intervention** could lead to the disappearance of birds that **feed on** those insects. **In the human realm**, some people imagine a world in which clones are used to fight wars or to provide body part replacements. Perhaps cloning could even be used to bring **deceased people** back to life, which would certainly be **a threat to humanity** as we know it.

A more optimistic prediction, and one that I favour, is that humans will find ways to **mitigate the risks** and **use genetic technologies** in a responsible way. **From the food production perspective**, genetic engineering could be **the solution to** famine in developing countries, if, for instance, crops can be grown more reliably in harsh conditions. From a medical perspective, scientists may use genetic engineering to **produce vaccines**, to **cure diseases**, or to **correct a genetic defect** before a child is born. If properly regulated, even cloning can be done in a way that improves lives. For example, the cloning of individual organs, such as a heart or **kidney**, could **be permitted for transplant purposes**.

In conclusion, **I am convinced that** genetic engineering will have a positive impact on our lives, and that **people's fears will be unwarranted**."
