- **Put first thing first.** Put the most important thing first.
- `Notice opportunity cost.`
- It’s okay to make a mistake, but not ok to repeat.
- Don't run away from problems. `Face problems`. Learn from mistakes. Find the real causes underneath, and figure out corresponding solutions.
- Get changed by pains. Don't get ruined by it.
- Keep learning. Pursue excellence.
- Stay open-minded.
- Do not believe in shortcuts.
- Never be full of yourself.
- Listen, really listen to others.
- Remember “Genuine love always promotes psychological maturity.” Be helpful to people you love.
- Be intelligent, self-disciplined, reasonable, while still lovely first. So that my kids would be able to learn that.
- Be effective.
- Control my own feelings. Keep proactive. Don’t behave reactively and emotionally.
- Feelings can lie. Notice the fact behind.
- Blaming will never work. Don't complain. Don't blame.
- Try to think at the place of others. Don't be self-centred.
- "The only thing I know is, I know nothing."--Socrates
