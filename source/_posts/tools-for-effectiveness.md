## To-do List apps

both can be syncronized on all devices(computer and phone)

### [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/home?language=en_US)

good points:

- best app in planning on phone so far
- very good calender

<!--more-->

bad points:

- only has mac version
- not very convenient on computer
- computer calender needs to pay

I use it everyday on phone,
so I don't forget small things in life
I do have bad memory unless I try to remember it..
This especially happens on learning.
The only way to remember is to repeat and repeat

### [Todoist]

good points:

- convenient to plan out one week
  I use it for study tasks every week last semester
  free version is enough

bad points:

- cannot check finished tasks for free version
- can only show tasks for one week

## Notes app

### [Evernote]

good points:

- great for notes (ideas, articles, business notes for you maybe)
- can be syncronized on all devices(computer and phone)
- can store up information

- has to-do list too, but not as convenient as top 2

I am using their Chinese-company version

## Google Chrome Extension

### [Synonyms](https://www.thesaurus.com/)

- not 100% accurate
- useful for formal writing

### [British Corpus](https://www.english-corpora.org/bnc/)

- how British use English
- I only use it when writing something serious but not sure (e.g. thesis)

## Simple but effective tip

Write down every task I finish on a paper. After dinner I check what I do that day. It's very painful to keep doing this everyday - sometimes I just wanna run away from it. But after a week, you'll find the power of it! I will try to keep doing this...

## In the end

Tools are just tools. The key is people who use them...
Still have a long way to be effective...Let's not lose heart and be better us️.😊
